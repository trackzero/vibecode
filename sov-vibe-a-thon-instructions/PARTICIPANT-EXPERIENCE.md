## How Participants Use This

### Step 1: Unzip & Open (30 seconds)
1. Participant receives `sov-vibe-a-thon-instructions.zip`
2. Unzips to their workspace
3. Opens folder in VS Code
4. Reads README.md

### Step 2: Start with AI Assistant (30 seconds)
Participant asks Cline: **"What should I build first for the Team Metrics application?"**

### Step 3: AI-Guided Development (89 minutes)
- **Cline reads CLINE_CONTEXT.md** and has complete knowledge of:
  - Event requirements and evaluation criteria
  - Technical specifications and architecture guidelines
  - Time management suggestions
  - Feature priorities and implementation order
  - Best practices for rapid development

- **Participant builds from scratch** with AI guidance:
  - "Help me set up a React application with authentication"
  - "Create an API endpoint for managing accomplishments"
  - "How should I implement role-based permissions?"

### Step 4: Documentation & Submission
- Participant fills out **AI-NOTES.md** throughout development
- Uses **DEMO-SCRIPT.md** template for video
- Refers to **EVENT_FAQ.md** for common questions

## Key Benefits of This Approach

### âœ… True AI-Assisted Development
- Participants build everything from scratch with AI help
- Authentic experience of AI-guided development workflow
- No pre-existing code to modify or understand

### âœ… Complete Context for AI
- Cline has comprehensive knowledge of all requirements
- AI can provide targeted, specific guidance
- Participants don't need to explain event details to AI

### âœ… Zero Setup Friction
- No dependencies to install
- No servers to start
- Instant engagement with development

### âœ… Pure Learning Focus
- 90 minutes of actual development time
- No time wasted on boilerplate setup
- Focus on AI collaboration patterns

## Example Participant Interaction

**Participant:** "What should I build first for the Team Metrics application?"

**Cline (with context):** "Based on the SOV Vibe-A-Thon requirements, I recommend starting with user authentication since it's a HIGH priority feature. Let's create a React application with a login system. Here's what we'll build first:

1. React app setup with routing
2. Login/register forms
3. JWT token handling
4. Role-based access (Admin, Team Lead, User)

This gives you a foundation for the CRITICAL accomplishment tracking features. Should I help you set up the React application structure first?"

**Participant:** "Yes, help me set up the React application structure"

**Cline:** "Perfect! Let's create a professional React application structure. I'll guide you through setting up..."

## Success Metrics

This approach enables participants to achieve all evaluation criteria:

- **Functional Implementation (40 pts)** - Build working features from scratch
- **AI Toolchain Effectiveness (30 pts)** - Document authentic AI collaboration
- **Code Quality & Structure (20 pts)** - Learn best practices through AI guidance  
- **Demo & Documentation (10 pts)** - Templates provided for both

---

**This instruction-only approach delivers the core value: authentic AI-assisted development learning in a time-constrained environment.**
