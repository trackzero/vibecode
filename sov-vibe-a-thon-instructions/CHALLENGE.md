## Development Priorities

### Phase 1 (First 30 minutes)
1. Set up authentication system
2. Create basic user registration/login
3. Implement user roles

### Phase 2 (Next 30 minutes)
1. Build accomplishment tracking
2. Create accomplishment forms
3. Implement accomplishment list/filtering

### Phase 3 (Final 30 minutes)
1. Add team management
2. Build basic reporting
3. Polish UI and fix bugs

## Time Management Tips

- **Focus on core functionality** over perfect design
- **Use AI assistance effectively** - ask specific questions
- **Test frequently** - make sure features work as you build
- **Document as you go** - capture AI usage patterns
- **Prioritize working features** over comprehensive features

## AI Assistant Usage

Your AI assistant (Cline) has comprehensive context about:
- Complete challenge requirements
- Evaluation criteria
- Technical implementation patterns
- Best practices for rapid development
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Effective AI prompts:**
- "Help me implement JWT authentication for this login form"
- "Create a React component for accomplishment filtering"
- "Build an API endpoint for team management with proper validation"
- "How should I structure the database for accomplishments and teams?"

## Submission Requirements

### Immediate (End of 90 minutes)
- **Complete project zip file**
- **README.md** with setup instructions
- **Working application** that runs locally
- **AI-NOTES.md** documenting AI assistance used

### Follow-up (By Monday)
- **5-minute demo video** showing key features
- **Best practices document** with lessons learned
- **Sample prompts** that worked effectively

## Evaluation Focus

Remember: This is about exploring AI-assisted development practices while building a functional application. The goal is to learn how to effectively collaborate with AI tools in a time-constrained environment.

**Key Questions:**
- How effectively did you use AI assistance?
- What development patterns worked best with AI?
- How did you manage the 90-minute time constraint?
- What would you do differently next time?
